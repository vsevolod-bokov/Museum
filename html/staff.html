              <h2>Jason Strummer</h2>
              <h3 class="profession">Instrument Archaeologist</h3>
              <h4 class="museum role">Curator at Musuem of Ancient Music</h4>
              <p class="staff-bio-p">
                Jason Strummer, a passionate musical instrument archaeologist, earned his degree in Ethnomusicology and Archaeological Sciences from the University of Edinburgh, where he combined his love for ancient cultures with the study of traditional instruments. His postgraduate training took him through field schools in Turkey and Peru, where he specialized in the preservation and reconstruction of ancient sound-making artifacts. Jason is skilled in acoustic analysis, carbon dating, instrument taxonomy, and ancient music transcription, and he's fluent in both Latin and Quechua. He frequently uses tools such as portable XRF analyzers, resonance imaging devices, 3D scanners, and handmade replica instruments to study soundscapes of past civilizations. Methodical yet eccentric, Jason has a deep intuition for cultural context, often relying on instinct as much as data, and is known for his unshakable curiosity, dry wit, and an obsessive attention to auditory detail—he claims he can “hear history in the grain of wood.”

              <p class="staff-bio-p">
                What makes him stand out in his field is his rare ability to bridge the gap between hard science and cultural intuition—he doesn’t just analyze instruments, he feels their stories. He’s received numerous recognitions, including a Fulbright Fellowship for his work on Mesoamerican wind instruments and a grant from the International Society for Musical Heritage for his reconstruction of a lost Bronze Age lyre using only traditional tools. Jason is neurodivergent—he has synesthesia, which allows him to associate sounds with colors and textures, giving him a uniquely immersive understanding of ancient acoustics. He often claims this “cross-sensory insight” helps him detect inconsistencies in reconstructions or forgeries that others might miss. Raised in a Romani-Greek household, Jason grew up around music as ritual and resistance, which deeply informs his philosophy that instruments are not merely artifacts, but living echoes of cultural identity. He speaks Greek, Romani, and Turkish, and is particularly drawn to the music traditions of nomadic and diasporic peoples, often advocating for their preservation through community-led research.

              <h2>Michael Humerus</h2>
              <h3 class="profession">Musician Anthropologist</h3>
              <h4 class="museum role">Curator at Musuem of Ancient Music</h4>
              <p class="staff-bio-p">
                Michael Humerus, an anthropologist specializing in ancient musicians and their societal roles, graduated with a dual degree in Cultural Anthropology and Ancient History from the University of Chicago, where his thesis explored the ritualistic functions of music in pre-Roman civilizations. He received advanced training through immersive fieldwork in Mesopotamia and the Levant, collaborating with local historians and excavating sites where ancient ensembles once performed. Michael's expertise includes symbolic analysis, ethnographic reconstruction, paleography, and comparative mythology, often focusing on how musicians were perceived—as shamans, servants, or storytellers. He employs tools such as archival drones, sonic mapping software, ethnographic databases, and a custom field notebook filled with hand-sketched reconstructions. Cerebral and soft-spoken, Michael is driven by empathy and a fascination with the human need for expression. He's known among colleagues for his poetic field notes, an encyclopedic memory for ancient lyrics, and a quiet reverence for the people behind the instruments.
              </p>
              <p class="staff-bio-p">
                What makes him stand out is his deep emotional intelligence and his ability to read between the lines of history—he’s less focused on the instruments themselves and more on the people who played them, often uncovering overlooked narratives in ancient texts and burial sites. He received a Mellon Foundation grant for his groundbreaking work tracing the lineage of female temple musicians in Sumerian culture and was awarded a UNESCO Cultural Heritage Fellowship for his collaborative documentation of endangered oral traditions in Central Asia. Michael is on the autism spectrum, and his extraordinary pattern recognition skills allow him to detect recurring motifs in myths, inscriptions, and cultural practices across disparate civilizations. Born to a deaf classical pianist and an opera historian, he grew up bilingual in ASL and English, which shaped his fascination with non-verbal modes of musical expression. He has a special connection to Hittite and Akkadian cultures, and is fluent in both cuneiform script and reconstructed Proto-Semitic languages. Philosophically, Michael sees music as a form of ancestral memory encoded in time, and his life's work aims to restore dignity to ancient musicians who were often viewed as secondary in historical narratives.

              <h2>Diane Teller</h2>
              <h3 class="profession">Symbolic Analyst</h3>
              <h4 class="museum role">Tour Program Developer at Musuem of Ancient Music</h4>
              <p class="staff-bio-p">
                Diane Teller is a Symbolic Analyst with a PhD in Cultural Semiotics from the University of Amsterdam, where she focused on decoding the ritual symbolism embedded in Bronze Age musical iconography. Her interpretive framework blends post-colonial analysis with indigenous epistemology, emphasizing the importance of contextualizing artifacts within the worldview of the cultures that created them rather than through modern Western assumptions. Diane has collaborated on exhibits with museums in Egypt, Malta, and Oaxaca, often working with local historians and artists to co-create narrative experiences that honor ancestral knowledge. She’s particularly drawn to ceremonial instruments, engraved lyres, and the spatial arrangement of performance sites—anything that hints at power dynamics, cosmology, or collective memory. A skilled communicator, Diane sees herself as a translator, turning esoteric data into accessible stories that spark empathy and cultural awareness. She views music not only as sound, but as a political, spiritual, and emotional force that reveals how societies imagined the sacred and the self.
              </p>
              <p class="staff-bio-p">
                Her interpretive method is multidimensional and story-centered—she believes that meaning is not extracted but reconstructed through layered interpretation. She begins by cross-referencing archaeological evidence with iconographic libraries, comparative mythology databases, and linguistic corpora, searching for recurring symbolic patterns. From there, she actively engages with living descendants, cultural memory holders, and indigenous scholars whenever possible, believing that living traditions often preserve subtle continuities modern scholarship overlooks. She also collaborates with cognitive scientists and AI modelers to simulate possible ritual scenarios—how instruments might have been used, by whom, and in what sensory environments. Finally, Diane brings her insights to life through immersive, multimedia exhibits, working closely with visual artists, composers, and performers to convey complex narratives in intuitive, emotional ways. Her approach is both analytical and affective—part ethnography, part theater—and always anchored in the belief that artifacts are incomplete without the voices that once surrounded them.
              </p>
              <p class="staff-bio-p">
                She brings a critical and often disruptive voice to the museum space, shaped by her identity as a woman of Afro-Caribbean and Indigenous Arawak descent. Her lived experience deeply informs her work, challenging dominant Eurocentric museum narratives and insisting on the inclusion of voices historically excluded from the academic canon. She is an outspoken advocate for repatriation and ethical storytelling, often pushing the museum to acknowledge its colonial legacies and support co-curation with source communities. Diane questions not just what museums display, but why and for whom, often proposing counter-colonial exhibit frameworks that center cultural sovereignty over scholarly authority. This has led to tension with Michael, whose archival rigor sometimes clashes with her interpretive storytelling, and with Jason, whose romanticization of instruments can occasionally sidestep the darker histories of their use. Despite these clashes, Diane sees conflict as generative—an essential part of evolving the institution toward justice, complexity, and truth.

              <p class="staff-bio-p">
                Her primary inspiration lenses are Indigenous Storywork, Cultural Semiotics, and Decolonial Museology, which she weaves together into a fluid, narrative-driven interpretive practice. From Indigenous Storywork, she draws the principle that stories are not just data—they are living teachings, carried through time with emotion, land, and responsibility. Cultural Semiotics gives her the analytical tools to decode visual and material symbols within their cultural contexts, while Decolonial Museology drives her ethical approach, insisting on accountability, voice-sharing, and dismantling extractive museum traditions. She is also deeply interested in the contrasts between patriarchal and matriarchal societies, particularly in how power, ritual, and sound intersect across gendered worldviews. Though not strictly aligned with post-structuralism, she appreciates its questioning of fixed meaning and uses it selectively to disrupt dominant narratives when they oversimplify or universalize complex cultural expressions.
